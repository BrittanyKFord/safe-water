# Safe Water

## Context

This is a Code for Boston project that is trying to predict
health-based drinking water violations using the
Environmental Protection Agency's
[Safe Drinking Water Information System](https://www.epa.gov/enviro/sdwis-model).


This project will analyze data from the EPAâ€™s Safe Drinking Water Information System
and then integrate other data sets to try to predict health-based drinking water
violations in the United States.
The [Conservation Law Foundation](https://www.clf.org/) has expressed interest in this project.
They might be a potential long-term partner. 

## Possible datasets

At first we start by considering one dataset.
[Safe Drinking Water Information System](https://www.epa.gov/enviro/sdwis-model).


In a second time, we will explore other datasets from the EPA,
including, but not limited to:

* the [Toxic Release Inventory database](https://www.epa.gov/enviro/tri-search),
* the [Superfund Enterprise Management System](https://www.epa.gov/enviro/sems-search),
* the [Environmental Radiation Monitoring database](https://www.epa.gov/radnet),
* the [Enforcement and Compliance History Outline](https://echo.epa.gov/). 

(Feel free to add link to new interesting datasets here)
