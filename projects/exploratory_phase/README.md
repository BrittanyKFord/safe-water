# Safe Water Project - Exploratory Phase

## Background

Throughout the first year of this project's existence, the Safe Water Project explored various publicly available resources on drinking water.

Note that the files have been moved around a couple times, which means that some relative paths in some files may need to be revised in order to be rerun. Additionally, GitHub does not accurately record contributors for files that have been renamed or move. Use ``git log --follow`` to see the full history of a file.
