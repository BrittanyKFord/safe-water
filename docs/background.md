# Background

## Water Contamination

Flint, Michigan dominated news cycles in early 2016, when it was [declared](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/01/16/president-obama-signs-michigan-emergency-declaration) to be in a state of emergency due to the city's lead-contaminated drinking water. Early childhood exposure to lead is known to have [irreversible negative side-effects](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/09/upshot/what-the-science-says-about-long-term-damage-from-lead.html). Water is a [significant contributor](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4961898/) to toxic lead exposure. People around the world were stunned at how this could happen in a nation as prosperous as the United States.

The water crisis in Flint was an especially egregious example of a problem that [persists](https://www.vox.com/2016/2/3/10904120/lead-exposure-flint-pennsylvania) across many American communities: many Americans are drinking water that may be poisoning them, but it's [almost impossible](https://www.vox.com/2016/2/17/11034642/lead-poisoning-flint-statistics-data) to know how bad lead poisoning is in your city. States have different requirements for [pediatric screening of lead exposure](https://scholarworks.alaska.edu/bitstream/handle/11122/4792/Sykes%20manuscript.pdf), and only one state (Delaware) follows the Center for Disease Control's (CDC) recommendations for screening. The water in Flint was unmistakably poisonous due to its [unnatural yellow hue and musky smell](https://www.businessinsider.com/heartbreaking-images-of-the-flint-crisis-2016-1). But lead poisoning is usually invisible to us, and lead can exceed extremely dangerous thresholds without anybody's knowledge. There could be more Flints out there right now, and in most cases, we'd have no idea.

Lead is far from the only water contaminant worth worrying about; there are [many more](https://www.epa.gov/ground-water-and-drinking-water/national-primary-drinking-water-regulations) organic and inorganic contaminants that are known to exist in some communities' drinking water and to have adverse side-effects. Additionally, there various so-called emerging contaminants which are known to be present in some communities' drinking water, but are completely unregulated. These contaminants pose additional problems compared to known contaminants because they are less likely to be tested for in water samples, and their health risks are unknown.

For a more detailed overview of drinking water contamination, you can read [this EPA report](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-10/documents/ace3_drinking_water.pdf).

## Regulatory Oversight

Safe drinking water is regulated federally by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), a federal agency devoted to the protection of the environment established in 1970. The EPA's regulatory authority over the safety of public drinking water is granted by [Safe Drinking Water Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe_Drinking_Water_Act) (SDWA) of 1974. The cleanliness of public water more generally, including stormwater and navagable waters, is also regulated by the [Clean Water Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_Water_Act) of 1972.

An amendment to the SDWA in 1996 established the [Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule (UCMR)](https://www.epa.gov/dwucmr/occurrence-data-unregulated-contaminant-monitoring-rule), which requires the EPA to create a list every 5 years of no more than 30 unregulated contaminants to be monitored by public water systems. The two most recent UCMRs are here:

* [UCMR 4](https://www.epa.gov/dwucmr/fourth-unregulated-contaminant-monitoring-rule) (2018-2020)
* [UCMR 3](https://www.epa.gov/dwucmr/third-unregulated-contaminant-monitoring-rule) (2013-2015)
