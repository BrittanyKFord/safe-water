At first we start by considering one dataset.
[Safe Drinking Water Information System](https://www.epa.gov/enviro/sdwis-model).

In a second time, we will explore other datasets from the EPA,
including, but not limited to:

* the [Toxic Release Inventory database](https://www.epa.gov/enviro/tri-search),
* the [Superfund Enterprise Management System](https://www.epa.gov/enviro/sems-search),
* the [Environmental Radiation Monitoring database](https://www.epa.gov/radnet),
* the [Enforcement and Compliance History Outline](https://echo.epa.gov/). 

(Feel free to add link to new interesting datasets here)
